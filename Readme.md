# Coding Assessment L-2 Code Submission

Welcome to my [submission](https://ecommerce-marmeto.vercel.app/) for the Coding Assessment L-2. Below you'll find details about my solution and how to access it.

## Solution Overview

### Approach

- Utilized **URL state** to fetch products and preserve state during page refreshes.
- Implemented a **loading spinner** while fetching data to improve user experience.
- Employed document **fragments for optimizations** to reduce reflows and repaints when adding multiple elements to the DOM.
- Changed the **_title and favicon dynamically_** for enhanced branding and user recognition.
- Ensured **responsiveness across all screen sizes** for accessibility and usability.
- Utilized _separate JavaScript files for separation of concerns_ to promote maintainability and scalability.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the project.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `js/`: JavaScript files for scripting logic.

  - `index.js` - main js
  - `service.js` - api calls
  - `utils.js` - helper functions
  - `ui.js` - UI files

- `icons`: For storing icons
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Testing

- Tested the code to ensure it produces the expected output.
- Confirmed that the console (Developer Tools) does not display any errors.

## Submission Process
