# Coding Assessment L-2 Code Submission

Welcome to my submission for the Coding Assessment L-2. Below you'll find details about my solution and how to access it.

## Solution Overview

### Approach

- Utilized URL state to fetch products and preserve state during page refreshes.
- Implemented a loading spinner while fetching data to improve user experience.
- Employed document fragments for optimizations to reduce reflows and repaints when adding multiple elements to the DOM.
- Dynamically changed the title and favicon for enhanced branding and user recognition.
- Ensured responsiveness across all screen sizes for accessibility and usability.
- Utilized separate JavaScript files for separation of concerns to promote maintainability and scalability.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the project.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `js/`: JavaScript files for scripting logic.
  -- `index.js` - main js
  -- `service.js` - api calls
  -- `utils.js` - helper functions
  -- `ui.js` - UI files

- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Testing

- Tested the code to ensure it produces the expected output.
- Confirmed that the console (Developer Tools) does not display any errors.

## Submission Process

### Option 1: GitHub Repository

1. Created a new public repository on GitHub.
2. Uploaded my project files (index.html, style.css, script.js) to the repository.
